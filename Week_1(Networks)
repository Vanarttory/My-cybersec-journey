What is a Switch?
A switch is a networking device that connects computers to each other.It allows devices to communicate and share data. Switches come in various sizes 

How Switches Work
Switches use Ethernet cables to connect devices.They transmit electrical signals through these cables.
Unlike hubs, switches are intelligent and can direct traffic efficiently.

Hubs vs. Switches
Hubs are basic devices that broadcast data to all connected devices.Switches intelligently send data only to the intended recipient.
This reduces network congestion and improves security.

Understanding Network Addresses
 Layer 2 addresses (MAC addresses) are used by switches to identify devices.
 Layer 3 addresses (IP addresses) are used for routing data across networks.
 Switches operate at Layer 2 and do not understand Layer 3 addresses.

Whst is the main difference between TCP/IP and OSI models?
 Basically, the OSI(Open Systems Interconnect) model has the exact same layers like the TCP/IP(Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol),
the only difference being that the OSI has 7 layers namely:
The Physical layer, the data link layer,the networking layer,the transport layer, the session layer, the presenation and lastly the apllication layer.
Whereas the TCP/IP model has 4 layers;  Physical, Network, Transport and Application layers.
