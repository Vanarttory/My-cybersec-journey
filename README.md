# My-cybersec-journey
This is a journey that i want to share as i dive to into the sea of Networks. I hope you have as much fun as i do :)

I am an aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst. Focused, passionate, and hungry to learn.  
Building my knowledge daily â€” one subnet, one scan, one exploit at a time. 

My current goal is to master Cybersecurity fundamentals and pass the security certifications.
